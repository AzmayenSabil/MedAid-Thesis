Initialize Scores:
For each disease in the dataset:
    Set the initial score to 0

Weighted Scoring:
For each symptom or answer provided by the patient:
    For each disease in the dataset:
        If the symptom is relevant to the disease:
            Increase the score of the disease by the weight assigned to the symptom

Score Adjustment:
For each disease in the dataset:
    Adjust the score based on the relevance and specificity of symptoms reported by the patient
    Adjust the score based on the severity or frequency of reported symptoms

Dynamic Score Updates:
After each question or response:
    Update the scores of potential diseases based on the accumulated patient data
    Consider conditional probabilities of symptoms occurring together in specific diseases

Threshold Determination:
Set a threshold score value to determine when a disease is considered highly likely or probable

Iterative Scoring:
Repeat the weighted scoring, score adjustment, and dynamic score updates process as more questions are asked and more information is gathered

Disease Reassessment:
Periodically reassess the scores and update the likelihood of diseases based on the accumulated patient information
Consider the temporal aspects of symptoms and potential changes in the patient's condition
